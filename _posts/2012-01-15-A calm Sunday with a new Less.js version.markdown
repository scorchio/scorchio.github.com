...so here it is: after the [Less throws an error on @import](https://github.com/cloudhead/less.js/issues/563?_nid=25874798) bug, the Less.js v1.2.1 is out - and with a working @import of course. I've played around with testing it and it seems it's working fine - I've already merged it into my Foundation-Less version.

I'm also working on making this blog somewhat better and more comfortable for myself. I've said goodbye to noisy.js, changed the layout a bit and added a Google Analytics tracking code. Also I hope that you'll like the sidebar with my contacts information. I want to make this site professional and personal at the same time ;)

I'm happy to say that the last week made my Git skills better - at last I'm comfortable using remote branches and merging. I feel I should re-read the excellent [Pro Git book](http://progit.org) soon, after all that was the book that made me sure to stick with Git :) I can absolutely recommend it to you, too, it will make you understand Git better so you won't stare at the screen at 3AM wondering what to do next to revert something.
